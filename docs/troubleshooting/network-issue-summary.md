254CARBON CONNECTIVITY TIMEOUT ISSUE - EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
================================================================================

ISSUE IDENTIFICATION
====================
Service connectivity timeout (~130 seconds) when pods/services attempt 
internal Kubernetes cluster communication.

ROOT CAUSE
==========
Kind cluster (Kubernetes in Docker) networking layer failure at the TCP 
connection establishment phase on veth bridge interfaces.

The cluster is running in Docker containers on the 'kind' bridge network,
and there's a blocking network interface or routing issue preventing TCP
packets from reaching pods properly.

AFFECTED COMPONENTS
===================
- Iceberg REST Catalog (cannot accept connections)
- Prometheus (cannot accept metrics queries)
- AlertManager (cannot accept alerts)
- Portal Service (cannot serve requests)
- Any inter-pod communication

WORKING COMPONENTS
==================
- Service DNS resolution (names resolve to IPs)
- Pod startup and initialization
- Kubernetes API server
- Service discovery mechanism
- Network policy framework

DIAGNOSTIC EVIDENCE
===================
1. DNS resolution works: iceberg-rest-catalog -> 10.96.31.74 ✓
2. Pods are running and healthy ✓
3. Service endpoints are registered ✓
4. TCP connections timeout after 130 seconds ✗
5. Direct pod-to-pod connectivity blocked ✗

NETWORK CONFIGURATION
=====================
- Node CIDR: 172.19.0.0/16 (Docker kind network)
- Control Plane: 172.19.0.2
- Service CIDR: 10.96.0.0/12
- Pod CIDR: 10.244.0.0/16
- Kube-proxy Mode: iptables
- Container Runtime: containerd 1.7.18

RECOMMENDED SOLUTIONS (in order of likelihood to succeed)
=========================================================

1. QUICK FIX (30 seconds):
   kubectl rollout restart ds/kube-proxy -n kube-system
   
2. MEDIUM FIX (2 minutes):
   docker exec dev-cluster-control-plane systemctl restart kubelet
   
3. FULL FIX (10 minutes):
   kind delete cluster --name dev-cluster
   kind create cluster --name dev-cluster [with optimized config]

For quick remediation steps: IMMEDIATE_REMEDIATION.md
For automated troubleshooting: bash scripts/troubleshoot-connectivity.sh

IMPACT ASSESSMENT
=================
CRITICAL - All inter-pod communication is blocked
          Services cannot accept client connections
          End-to-end platform is non-functional

PREVENTION
==========
1. Use production-grade Kubernetes (EKS, GKE, AKS) for production workloads
2. Kind is designed for local development/testing only
3. Implement network health monitoring
4. Regular connectivity verification in CI/CD
