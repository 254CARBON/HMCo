# 254Carbon Production Migration Plan

## Executive Summary

This document outlines the strategy for migrating the 254Carbon data platform from the current single-node Kind cluster to a production-grade multi-node Kubernetes cluster.

**Current State**: 26 pods running across 12 namespaces, 95% production ready
**Target State**: Multi-node HA cluster with enterprise-grade reliability
**Timeline**: 1-2 weeks for complete migration
**Risk Level**: ðŸŸ¡ Medium (well-planned migration)

## Current Platform Assessment

### Deployed Components (âœ… Complete)

**Core Infrastructure**:
- Kubernetes cluster (Kind v1.31.0) - Single node
- NGINX Ingress Controller - Running
- Cert-Manager with Let's Encrypt - Active
- Harbor Private Registry - Deployed and ready
- Cloudflare Tunnel - Operational

**Data Platform Services** (12 services):
- DataHub (metadata platform)
- Trino (SQL query engine)
- Doris (OLAP database)
- Superset (BI dashboards)
- MinIO (object storage)
- Vault (secrets management)
- PostgreSQL (primary database)
- Kafka (message streaming)
- Redis (caching)
- Elasticsearch (search)
- DolphinScheduler (workflow orchestration)
- LakeFS (data versioning)

**Enhanced Monitoring**:
- Prometheus Operator with ServiceMonitors
- Grafana with custom dashboards
- Loki for centralized logging
- AlertManager for notifications

**Security & Operations**:
- SSO infrastructure (Cloudflare Access ready)
- Network policies and RBAC configured
- Pod disruption budgets active
- Resource quotas and limits applied

### Current Limitations

**Single Point of Failure**:
- All 26 pods on one Kind node
- No high availability for any service
- Resource constraints (8 vCPU, 16Gi RAM)

**Development-Grade Infrastructure**:
- Kind cluster designed for local development
- Limited scalability and performance
- No production storage backends

## Migration Strategy Options

### Option C: Hybrid Approach

**Target**: Start with bare metal, migrate to cloud later
**Timeframe**: 2 weeks
**Benefits**:
- Immediate production deployment
- Test production workflows
- Migrate to cloud when ready

## Recommended Architecture

## Migration Phases

### Phase 1: Infrastructure Preparation (Week 1)

#### 1.1 Choose Migration Target
```bash
# Decision Point: Choose migration strategy
# A: Cloud (EKS/GKE/AKS) - Recommended for speed
# B: Bare Metal - Recommended for control/cost
# C: Hybrid - Recommended for flexibility
```

#### 1.2 Provision Production Infrastructure
- **Cloud Option**: Create EKS/GKE/AKS cluster
- **Bare Metal Option**: Install Kubernetes on 3-5 servers
- **Hybrid Option**: Start with bare metal, plan cloud migration

#### 1.3 Configure Production Storage
- Deploy OpenEBS or Ceph for persistent volumes
- Configure MinIO distributed mode for object storage
- Set up backup storage locations

### Phase 2: Data Migration (Week 1-2)

#### 2.1 Backup Current State
```bash
# Backup all persistent data
kubectl apply -f k8s/storage/velero-backup-config.yaml
velero backup create platform-backup --include-namespaces data-platform,monitoring,vault-prod
```

#### 2.2 Deploy Platform to Production
- Install base infrastructure (ingress, cert-manager, monitoring)
- Deploy shared services (PostgreSQL, Kafka, Redis)
- Deploy data platform services
- Configure SSO and security policies

#### 2.3 Data Migration
- Restore PostgreSQL databases
- Migrate MinIO data
- Configure Kafka topics and schema registry
- Restore Elasticsearch indices

### Phase 3: Validation & Cutover (Week 2)

#### 3.1 Parallel Testing
- Run platform in parallel on both clusters
- Validate all services and data flows
- Test backup and restore procedures
- Verify monitoring and alerting

#### 3.2 DNS and Traffic Migration
- Update DNS records to point to production cluster
- Validate external connectivity
- Test SSO authentication flow
- Verify service accessibility

#### 3.3 Cutover Execution
- Final data synchronization
- Traffic switch to production cluster
- Monitor for issues and rollback if needed
- Decommission development cluster
