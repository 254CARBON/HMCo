# Phase 4: Testing & Validation - Getting Started (Archived)

**Status**: READY TO BEGIN  
**Date**: October 19, 2025  
**Duration**: 2-3 hours estimated  
**Prerequisite**: Phase 2 applications created ✅

---

## Overview

Phase 4 is the final validation phase that ensures SSO is working correctly across all services, meets security requirements, and performs well under load.

**What You'll Do:**
- Run 30+ comprehensive test procedures
- Verify security and performance
- Document test results
- Prepare for user rollout

---

## Quick Start (Choose One Path)

### Path A: Quick Smoke Test (5-10 minutes)
*Just verify the system works*

1. Open private browser window
2. Visit https://254carbon.com
3. Verify redirects to Cloudflare login
4. Test email OTP (enter email, receive code, validate)
5. Check portal loads with all 9 service cards
6. Click one service - should load without re-auth

✅ If all pass → System is working!

### Path B: Comprehensive Testing (2-3 hours)
*Full validation before user rollout*

1. Follow: `SSO_VALIDATION_GUIDE.md`
2. Execute all test categories:
   - Authentication Flow (4 tests)
   - Service Access (9 tests)
   - Security Validation (6 tests)
   - Audit Logging (3 tests)
   - Performance Testing (3 tests)
   - Complete Checklist (20+ items)
3. Document all results
4. Fix any issues found

✅ If all pass → Ready for production!

## Current System Status

**All Components Ready:**
- ✅ Portal deployed and accessible
- ✅ 10 Cloudflare Access applications created
- ✅ Tunnel connected
- ✅ Ingress rules with auth deployed
- ✅ Local auth disabled (Grafana & Superset)
- ✅ Services running

**Expected Behavior:**
```
1. User visits https://254carbon.com
   └─ Redirects to Cloudflare login

2. User enters email
   └─ Receives one-time code

3. User enters code
   └─ Portal displays with 9 service cards

4. User clicks any service
   └─ Service loads without re-authentication

5. Session valid across all services
   └─ Duration per service (2-24 hours)
```

## Testing Categories

### 1. Authentication Flow (Est. 20 minutes)
Tests: Portal redirect, email OTP, session creation, persistence

**Quick Test:**
```bash
# In private window:
# 1. Visit https://254carbon.com
# 2. Should redirect to Cloudflare login page
# 3. Enter email → receive OTP
# 4. Enter OTP code → redirect to portal
# 5. Check for CF-Access-JWT-Assertion cookie in dev tools
```

### 2. Service Access (Est. 15 minutes)
Tests: All 9 services, no re-authentication, session persistence

**Quick Test:**
```bash
# After authenticating at portal:
# 1. Click Grafana → should load
# 2. Click Vault → should load
# 3. Visit any service directly (should already be logged in)
# 4. No login prompts should appear
```

### 3. Security Validation (Est. 20 minutes)
Tests: Unauthorized access blocked, tokens validated, timeouts working

**Quick Test:**
```bash
# 1. New private window → try to access https://vault.254carbon.com
#    → Should redirect to login (access denied without auth)
# 2. Try with invalid token → 401 response
# 3. Session expires → re-authentication required
```

### 4. Performance Testing (Est. 10 minutes)
Tests: Response time, load capacity, resource usage

**Quick Test:**
```bash
# After login, measure response times:
# 1. Portal: <100ms
# 2. Grafana: <500ms
# 3. Vault: <500ms
# 4. Other services: <500ms each
```

### 5. Audit Logging (Est. 10 minutes)
Tests: All access logged, timestamps correct, user email recorded

**Quick Test:**
```bash
# 1. Go to Cloudflare Dashboard → Zero Trust → Access → Logs
# 2. Should see recent login attempts
# 3. Should see service access records
# 4. Each entry should have: email, service, timestamp, allow/deny
```

## Quick Decision Matrix

| Situation | What to Do |
|-----------|-----------|
| First time testing | Do Quick Smoke Test (5-10 min) |
| Before user rollout | Do Comprehensive Testing (2-3 hours) |
| Regular validation | Do Quick Smoke Test quarterly |
| Troubleshooting issue | Check relevant section in Comprehensive Guide |
| Performance concern | Run Performance Testing section |
| Security concern | Run Security Validation section |

## Important Notes

⚠️  **Before Testing:**
- Use private/incognito browser window (no cached sessions)
- Clear cookies before testing access control
- Test from different network if possible (to test geo rules)

✅ **Expected Behavior:**
- Single login grants access to ALL services
- No double authentication between services
- Session persists for configured duration per service
- Vault session shortest (2 hours) for security
- All access logged in Cloudflare

📋 **What's Being Tested:**
- Portal redirects correctly to Cloudflare
- Email OTP authentication works
- Services are protected (require auth)
- Services are accessible (after auth)
- Session management works
- Audit trail is captured
- Performance meets targets
- Security policies enforced

---

## Next Steps After Testing

**If All Tests Pass:**
1. Update user documentation
2. Announce SSO to team
3. Provide access instructions
4. Monitor first 24 hours
5. Review audit logs regularly

**If Issues Found:**
1. Note specific issue
2. Check troubleshooting in `SSO_VALIDATION_GUIDE.md`
3. Fix configuration
4. Re-test specific area
5. Document change
