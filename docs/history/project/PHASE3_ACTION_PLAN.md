# Phase 3: Action Plan - Multi-Node Cluster Expansion

**Current Status**: Phase 3 Continuation Started (Oct 20, 2025)  
**Objective**: Expand to multi-node HA cluster  
**Timeline**: 2-3 days  
**Blocker**: Requires infrastructure team to provision worker nodes

---

## Summary

Phase 3 resource quota fixes have been completed. The next step requires **external infrastructure** to provision 2-3 worker nodes. Once available, follow the guide in `PHASE3_MULTINODE_SETUP.md` to expand the cluster.

---

## What's Ready NOW

✅ **Cluster Foundation**
- Metrics-server deployed (HPA capability)
- Resource limits applied (pod scheduling)
- Pod Disruption Budgets configured (service protection)
- Anti-affinity rules ready (load distribution)
- HPA rules active (auto-scaling ready)

✅ **Documentation**
- `PHASE3_MULTINODE_SETUP.md` - Complete setup guide (11 steps)
- Worker node preparation scripts (ready to copy/paste)
- Testing procedures (node failure, pod distribution)
- Troubleshooting guide (common issues)

✅ **Infrastructure**
- Control plane ready for worker nodes
- Networking prepared for multi-node
- Storage ready for distributed setup

---

## External Dependency: Worker Nodes

### Required Infrastructure

You need to provision:
- **2-3 Virtual Machines** (or cloud instances)
- **OS**: Debian/Ubuntu 20.04+ or equivalent
- **CPU**: 4+ cores per node
- **RAM**: 8GB+ per node
- **Storage**: 100GB+ per node
- **Network**: Access to 172.19.0.0/16 (control plane network)

### Provisioning Options

1. **Local VMs** (VMware, VirtualBox, KVM)
   - Most control
   - Can be on same physical machine
   - Good for testing/staging

2. **Cloud** (AWS, GCP, Azure)
   - EC2 instances, Compute Engine, VMs
   - Managed networking
   - Scalable

3. **Hybrid** (some local, some cloud)
   - Mixed approach
   - Good for distributed testing

### Resource Sizing

For production, recommend:
- **Small**: 4 vCPU, 16GB RAM, 100GB storage per node
- **Medium**: 8 vCPU, 32GB RAM, 200GB storage per node
- **Large**: 16 vCPU, 64GB RAM, 500GB storage per node

For testing, minimum is acceptable:
- 2 vCPU, 4GB RAM, 50GB storage

## Timeline

### Phase 3 Multi-Node Expansion (2-3 Days)

**Day 1: Node Provisioning & Preparation**
- [ ] Provision 2-3 worker nodes
- [ ] Install OS and update system
- [ ] Install containerd and kubernetes tools
- [ ] Configure networking prerequisites
- [ ] Disable swap and prepare for kubeadm

**Day 2: Cluster Expansion**
- [ ] Generate join token on control plane
- [ ] Run join command on each worker node
- [ ] Verify all nodes show "Ready" status
- [ ] Label worker nodes appropriately
- [ ] Monitor pod redistribution

**Day 3: Verification & Testing**
- [ ] Verify pod distribution across nodes
- [ ] Test pod anti-affinity rules
- [ ] Simulate node failure (drain/cordon)
- [ ] Verify service recovery
- [ ] Confirm multi-node HA working
- [ ] Document any issues

### After Phase 3 Complete

Then can proceed to:
- **Phase 4**: Enhanced Monitoring (2-3 days)
- **Phase 5**: Backup & DR (2 days)
- **Phase 6**: Performance optimization (2 days)
- **Phase 7**: GitOps implementation (1-2 days)
- **Phase 8**: Final audit & testing (1 day)

---

## How to Proceed

### Option A: Manual Infrastructure Provisioning
1. Manually provision VMs
2. SSH into each node
3. Follow Step 1 in `PHASE3_MULTINODE_SETUP.md`
4. Run join commands on each node
5. Follow verification steps

### Option B: Infrastructure-as-Code (Recommended)
```bash
# Example with Terraform or cloud CLI
# Provision nodes with infrastructure team
# They provide node IPs and SSH access
# Then follow the setup guide
```

### Option C: Parallel Execution (Fastest)
1. Team A: Provisions worker nodes
2. Team B: Starts Phase 4 monitoring setup
3. Both working simultaneously
4. Faster overall completion

---

## Commands for Control Plane

Once worker nodes are ready, on control plane:

```bash
# Step 1: Generate join token
kubeadm token create --print-join-command

# Example output:
# kubeadm join 172.19.0.2:6443 --token abc123.def456 --discovery-token-ca-cert-hash sha256:abcd1234...

# Step 2: Verify nodes join (on each completion)
kubectl get nodes
kubectl describe nodes

# Step 3: Label worker nodes
kubectl label node worker-node-1 node-role.kubernetes.io/worker=worker
kubectl label node worker-node-2 node-role.kubernetes.io/worker=worker
kubectl label node worker-node-3 node-role.kubernetes.io/worker=worker

# Step 4: Monitor pod distribution
kubectl get pods -A -o wide -w

# Step 5: Test node failure
kubectl drain worker-node-2 --ignore-daemonsets --delete-emptydir-data
kubectl uncordon worker-node-2
```

---

## Success Indicators

You'll know Phase 3 is working when:

1. ✅ All nodes show "Ready" in `kubectl get nodes`
2. ✅ Pods distributed across all nodes (`kubectl get pods -A -o wide`)
3. ✅ HPA metrics working (`kubectl top nodes`, `kubectl top pods`)
4. ✅ Pod anti-affinity working (pods on different nodes)
5. ✅ Node drain succeeds without service interruption
6. ✅ Pods return after uncordon
7. ✅ Services remain available during maintenance

---

## Blockers & Issues

### Blocked By
- Worker node infrastructure not available
- Network connectivity between nodes
- Kubernetes version mismatch

### Can Proceed Anyway
- Database replication (can wait)
- Phase 4 monitoring (no dependency on multi-node)
- Phase 5 backup (can use single-node backup)

---

## Alternative: Single-Node Production

If multi-node infrastructure is unavailable:

1. Keep current single-node setup
2. Proceed to Phase 4 (Enhanced Monitoring)
3. Proceed to Phase 5 (Backup & DR)
4. Proceed to Phase 7 (GitOps)
5. Skip Phase 3 distributed tests
6. Expand to multi-node later when infrastructure available

**Note**: Single-node is single point of failure, but can run production with proper backup/DR procedures.

## Next Action Required

**Awaiting**: Infrastructure team to provision 2-3 worker nodes

**Once Available**:
1. Provide node IPs and SSH access
2. Follow `PHASE3_MULTINODE_SETUP.md` Step 1 on each node
3. Generate join token (provided in guide)
4. Run join commands
5. Verify cluster expansion

  - HPA configured

Phase 3 Multi-Node Expansion: ⏳ BLOCKED (Waiting for infrastructure)
  - Documentation ready
  - Setup procedures documented
  - Testing plan prepared
