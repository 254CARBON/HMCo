## In-Progress Tasks

### Task 2: Mirror Container Images ‚è≥

**Status**: IN PROGRESS - Setup complete, mirroring starting

**What's being done**:
1. Identified 40+ container images across services:
   - Infrastructure (4 images)
   - Monitoring (5 images)
   - Data platform (4 images)
   - Storage & Secrets (5 images)
   - Messaging (3 images)
   - Elasticsearch (2 images)
   - Workflow & Compute (6 images)
   - Data Lake (3 images)
   - Utilities (3 images)

2. Created mirroring script with:
   - Docker pull from source registries
   - Tag for Harbor registry
   - Docker push to Harbor
   - Error handling and reporting

**Script Location**: `/tmp/mirror-status.sh`

**Critical Images (High Priority)**:
- postgres:15.5
- redis:7.2
- minio:RELEASE.2024-01-11T08-13-15Z
- grafana:10.2.0
- nginx-ingress
- prometheus
- doris
- trino

**Estimated Duration**: 
- Critical images: 1-2 hours
- All 40+ images: 3-5 hours

**Next Steps**:
- Execute mirroring for all images (parallel where possible)
- Verify push success for each image
- Generate mirroring report

### Task 5: Initialize Vault ‚è≥

**Status**: IN PROGRESS - Port conflict resolution needed

**What was attempted**:
1. Scaled Vault from 0 to 1 replica
2. Vault pod started but encountered error:
   ```
   Error initializing listener: listen tcp4 0.0.0.0:8200: bind: address already in use
   ```

**Root Cause**: Port 8200 still in use from previous deployment

**What was done**:
1. Scaled Vault back down to 0
2. Waiting for port to release

**Next Steps**:
1. Wait 30-60 seconds for port release
2. Scale Vault back to 1
3. Run initialization: `./scripts/initialize-vault-production.sh init`
4. Generate unseal keys
5. Configure Kubernetes auth
6. Scale to 3 replicas

**Expected Duration**: 1-2 hours

## Pending Tasks

### Task 3: Update Deployment Images ‚è≥

**Status**: PENDING - Waiting for image mirroring completion

**What needs to be done**:
1. Update all deployment YAML files with Harbor registry URLs
2. Or use kubectl set-image commands
3. Trigger pod restarts

**Will execute after**: Image mirroring completes

### Task 6: Restore Services ‚è≥

**Status**: PENDING - Waiting for registry and images

**Services to restore**:
1. MinIO
2. Doris (FE + BE)
3. Trino
4. Superset
5. DolphinScheduler
6. LakeFS
7. Others

**Will execute after**: Deployment images updated
