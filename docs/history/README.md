# Documentation History Archive

This folder contains archived status reports, completion summaries, and phase guides retained for historical context. Canonical, actively maintained documentation lives under docs/.

Guidance
- Prefer linking to docs/ pages for implementation and operations.
- Treat files here as read-only records of past states.
- Subfolders:
  - `project/` – phase reports, readiness summaries, delivery notes
  - `cloudflare/` – tunnel stabilization reports and service snapshots
  - `incidents/` – retained incident timelines and remediation records
