### Data Flow
1. Market data ingestion → ClickHouse
2. Feature engineering → Derived features
3. Model training → Trained models (stored in MLflow)
4. Real-time inference → Predictions to ClickHouse
5. Analytics → Signals and attribution
6. Execution → Order optimization
7. Portal → Visualization and alerts

## Testing Status

### Current State
- Minimal existing test infrastructure for new Python modules
- Existing tests focus on services and workflows (see `tests/unit/services/`)
- New modules follow similar patterns to existing codebase

### Recommendations for Testing
Once data pipelines are established, tests should be added for:

1. **Unit Tests**
   - Feature extraction logic
   - Model training/inference functions
   - Shapley value calculations

2. **Integration Tests**
   - End-to-end workflows with sample data
   - ClickHouse schema validation
   - Model serialization/deserialization

3. **Validation Tests**
   - DoD metric calculations
   - Historical backtest validation
   - Prediction accuracy monitoring

## Dependencies

### Python Libraries Required
- **ML/Stats**: numpy, pandas, scikit-learn, scipy
- **Graph**: networkx (for topology analysis)
- **Clustering**: hdbscan (for motif mining)
- **Database**: clickhouse-driver (for ClickHouse integration)
- **Serialization**: pickle (for model persistence)

These should be added to appropriate requirements files when the modules are deployed.

## Deployment Considerations

### Phase 1: Development
- ✓ Module structure created
- ✓ Core algorithms implemented
- ✓ Database schemas defined
- ✓ Workflow definitions created

### Phase 2: Testing (Next Steps)

- Monitor prediction accuracy

### Phase 4: Production
- Deploy to production
- Integrate with live trading systems
- Set up monitoring and alerting
- Continuous model retraining

## DoD Metrics Tracking

Each feature has specific Definition of Done criteria that must be validated:

| Feature | DoD Metric | Validation Method |
|---------|-----------|------------------|
| PTDF/LODF | Correlation ≥ 0.8 | Historical outage analysis |
| Imbalance | ≥20% cost reduction | Backtest with hedge |
| Ancillary | +10% portfolio P&L | Historical replay |
| Motifs | ≥60% capture, >2:1 P:R | Alert performance analysis |
| Tail | ≥90% spike coverage | Exceedance tracking |
| Unit Commit | ≥15% Brier improvement | Probability calibration |
| LNG | ≥30% variance explained | Event study analysis |
| Execution | ≥30% slippage reduction | Paper trade comparison |
| Carbon | −10% variance | Backtest with neutralization |
| Attribution | ≥70% variance by top-3 | P&L decomposition |
