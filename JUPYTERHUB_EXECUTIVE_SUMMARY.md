## Architecture Highlights

```
Users → Cloudflare Access (OAuth) → NGINX Ingress → 
JupyterHub Proxy → Hub (management) → User Pods (notebooks)
                                          ↓
                     Platform Services (Trino, MinIO, etc.)
```

### Scalability
- 100+ concurrent users (depends on cluster)
- Dynamic pod spawning per user
- Horizontal scaling of hub/proxy
- Persistent user data

### High Availability
- 2 hub replicas (automatic failover)
- 2 proxy replicas (load distribution)
- Pod anti-affinity rules
- Self-healing via Kubernetes

## Resource Requirements

### Per User
- CPU: 2 cores (request) / 4 cores (limit)
- Memory: 8Gi (request) / 16Gi (limit)
- Storage: 10Gi per user

### Hub Infrastructure
- CPU: 500m request / 2 limit
- Memory: 1Gi request / 4Gi limit
- Shared storage: 50Gi

### Cluster Minimum
