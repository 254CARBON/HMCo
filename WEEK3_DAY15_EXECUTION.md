## Load Test Execution Plan

### Phase 1: 100k Message Production (10-20 seconds)

**Test Configuration**:
```
Total Messages: 100,000
Message Format: JSON (commodity prices)
Production Rate: 7,000-10,000 msg/sec
Partitioning: Round-robin across 3 partitions
Replication: 3x (high durability)
Failure Handling: Producer retry on failure
```

**Expected Results**:
```
Production Completion: 10-20 seconds
Partition Distribution: ~33k per partition
Replication Lag: < 100ms
Producer Success Rate: 99.9%+
```

### Phase 2: Consumer Lag Monitoring (Continuous)

**Monitoring Points**:
```
Pre-Test Baseline:
├─ Lag should be minimal (no new messages)
├─ Consumer group offset: caught up
└─ Status: Healthy and ready

During Test:
├─ Lag increases as messages arrive
├─ Peak lag: < 5 seconds (target)
├─ Processing rate: 7,000+ msg/sec
└─ CPU/Memory: Normal utilization

Post-Test Validation:
├─ Final lag: < 5 seconds
├─ All partitions: fully consumed
├─ No messages: left unconsumed
└─ Consumer status: Healthy
```

### Phase 3: Performance Metrics Collection

**Key Metrics**:
```
Throughput:
├─ Producer rate: 7,000-10,000 msg/sec
├─ Consumer rate: 7,000+ msg/sec
└─ End-to-end latency: < 5 seconds

Reliability:
├─ Message loss: 0%
├─ Duplicate messages: Validated
├─ Error handling: Verified
└─ Recovery success: 100%

Resource Utilization:
├─ Producer CPU: 500m-1000m
├─ Consumer CPU: 500m-1000m per replica
├─ Kafka CPU: 2-4 cores total
└─ Network: < 100Mbps peak
```

---

## Consumer Lag Details

### Expected Lag Behavior

```
Before Test Start:
├─ All partitions: offset at end
├─ Consumer lag: 0 messages
└─ Status: Ready

Message Arrival (first 5 seconds):
├─ Lag increases as messages arrive
├─ Rate limited by producer: 7,000+ msg/sec
├─ Peak lag at t=5-10s: ~35,000-50,000 messages
└─ Consumer latency: <1s per 1000 messages

Processing (t=10-20 seconds):
├─ Consumer catches up
├─ Lag decreases: 50k → 10k → 1k → <100
├─ Final lag: < 5 messages per partition
└─ Status: Consumer fully caught up

Final State:
├─ Partition 0 lag: 1-2 messages
├─ Partition 1 lag: 1-2 messages
├─ Partition 2 lag: 1-2 messages
└─ Total lag: < 15 messages (EXCELLENT)
```

## Failure Scenario Testing

### Scenario 1: Pod Crash Recovery

**Timeline**:
```
t=0s: System stable (3/3 pods running)
t=5s: Simulate pod crash (delete pod)
t=5-10s: Kubernetes detects and recreates pod
t=10-15s: Pod starts, consumer joins group
t=15-20s: Partitions rebalanced
t=20s+: Normal operation resumed

Expected Outcome:
├─ New pod created: YES ✓
├─ Recovery time: < 30 seconds
├─ Message loss: 0 messages
├─ Processing resume: < 5 seconds
└─ Success rate: 99%+
```

**Validation Checks**:
- New pod IP address assigned
- Consumer group membership updated
- Partitions re-assigned automatically
- No gap in consumer offsets
- Throughput returns to baseline

### Scenario 2: Kafka Broker Failure

**Timeline**:
```
t=0s: System stable (3/3 brokers, 3x replication)
t=10s: Gracefully shutdown broker-1
t=10-15s: Rebalancing: ISR changes 3 → 2
t=15-60s: Producer/Consumer continue
t=60s: Restart broker-1
t=60-90s: Re-join cluster, replica sync
t=90s+: Back to 3x replication

Expected Outcome**:
├─ ISR reduced to 2: YES ✓
├─ Latency increase: < 100ms
├─ Message loss: 0
├─ Processing resume: Immediate
├─ Re-sync time: < 30 seconds
└─ Back to 3x replication: YES ✓
```

### Scenario 3: Network Partition

**Timeline**:
```
t=0s: Baseline throughput (7,153+ msg/sec)
t=10s: Introduce latency (add 500ms)
t=10-30s: Consumer lag increases
t=30s: Remove latency
t=30-45s: System stabilizes

Expected Outcome**:
├─ Throughput reduction: 20-30%
├─ Lag spike: Up to 60 seconds
├─ Recovery time: < 30 seconds
├─ Final lag: < 5 seconds
├─ Message loss: 0
└─ System stability: RECOVERED ✓
```
